If the chest doesn't rise with the second breath, the person may be choking. After each subsequent set of 30 chest compressions, and before attempting breaths, look for an object and, if seen, remove it.\n"+

            "3.Attach the AED pads, and plug in the connector (if necessary).\n"+
            "4.Make sure no one is, including you, is touching the person. Tell everyone to \"stand clear.\"\n"+
